# dripfeed

This is a site which enables healthier, more deliberate browsing of BlueSky. It displays posts from a list of followed accounts one at a time, in ascending chronological order. Once you click next, you'll never see the post again. This means that you will eventually get caught up, and have no more BlueSky to read.

Visit https://epswartz.github.io/dripfeed to use the app (Currently a POC with a few static posts).
